[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:86 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlaunch_testing.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "launch_testing", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "launch_testing"
  with any of the following names:

    launch_testingConfig.cmake
    launch_testing-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "launch_testing" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "launch_testing_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "launch_testing" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
